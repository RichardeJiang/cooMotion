CoMotion

This app is used to help the user with their training. Android smartphones with the app installed can start recording videos simultaneously using Wi-Fi Direct P2P communication. If smartwatches are connected to one of the devices, it'll be able to collect readings from the linear-accelerometer at the same time.

For details of the app please refer to the developer guide.
